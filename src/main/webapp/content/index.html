	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>
		This body of work is designed to be a series of tutorials with emphasis 
		on being an intermediate full stack java developer. The objective is to 
		take someone who has little to no experience with programming and give 
		them the tools to learn how to be an entry level to intermediate level 
		programmer.
	</p>
	<h2>Philosophy</h2>
	<p>
		Before I begin, I want to give you a reasonable idea of what to expect. 
		Here are two key principles I will follow and the reasons why.
	</p>
	<h3>Brevity</h3>
	<p>
		I am not trying to give you an exhaustive textual reference of all 
		Java's capabilities. I wish to teach you the things you must know and 
		give you the tools to figure out or explore the rest.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you would like an exhaustive reference, try a textbook. A text book 
		that I own and I enjoyed is Modern software development using Java by 
		Paul T. Tymann and G. Michael Schneider. It is by no means necessary if 
		you wish to follow the upcoming tutorials.
	</p> 
	<h3>Experiential Learning</h3>
	<p>
		My experience suggests experience is the best teacher. While I will 
		avoid writing long essays explaining how to do things, I will try my 
		best to ensure there are lots of examples and exercises to do.
	</p>
	<h2>Misconceptions</h2>
	<p>
		Before I conclude, there are some things I want to say about the 
		software industry because I have a suspicion that people outside of the 
		software industry think some of these things.
	</p>
	<h3>Learning a Programming Language means you'll be Successful</h3>
	<p>
		Learning a programming language helps; however, it is more important 
		you understand language agnostic programming concepts. Full stack 
		programmers rarely use one language. They use several languages and 
		each one tends to be well suited to solving a particular problem. 
		Understanding language agnostic programming concepts allows you to 
		learn languages with relative ease. 
	</p>
	<h3>Full stack java developers only use Java</h3>
	<p>
		They don't and we won't. I suspect it's impossible to be a full stack 
		java developer only using Java.
	</p>
	<p>
		Furthermore, programming languages have ecosystems. A person can have 
		mediocre Java skills but a strong understanding of the Java ecosystem 
		and as a result be an excellent full stack developer. For reference, 
		programming language ecosystems are technologies related to a language 
		that are closely related and impact the development of one another (and 
		in some cases, the language itself).
	</p>
	<h3>Languages Don't Change</h3>
	<p>
		Java has multiple versions and each version has multiple updates. In 
		English words change, even fall out of popularity or become obsolete. 
		Though the reasons may differ, the same is true in computer programming 
		languages.
	</p>
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>
		Thanks for reading. I will update in future with some outline of what I 
		intend to teach and the tools required!
